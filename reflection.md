- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
I initially thought that 'Association' means there are relationships existing between different objects(methods). After drawing this scarecrow, I noticed that one of the specific kind of association is that many parts are joining together in order to make the whole thing completed. This composition relationship is between the scarecrow and its head, shirt, pants, and boots. In this case, we also added banner above the head.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I drawed the body successfully but I met some problem one the command line step. I consulted Tina for this question and we fixed it. I would advice others to work together or go ask for help we you are struggling on one single problem. It is more effective and productive when you are working together on the code.
